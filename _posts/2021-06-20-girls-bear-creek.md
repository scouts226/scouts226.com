The Girls had a really good time at bear creek! They got to do all sorts of fun
things like COPE, archery, handicrafts, ecology, and the rangers had lots of fun
doing a little bit of everything. One of the best parts of camp is seeing all
the firsts years and the patrols learn more about eachother over the week and
work together better. I think that everyone in the troop learned a few good
lessons and is exited for next campout.
