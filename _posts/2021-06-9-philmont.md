Eight scouts from Troop 226 along with four adults, trekked 70 miles across the
rugged beauty of the Philmont Scout Ranch in June. Carrying their personal gear
and a share of crew gear, the scouts were prepared for all possibilities,
including; hanging bear bags, hail storms, climbing a 12,441 ft mountain, and
crossing mountain streams. Building on the scouting motto of "Be Prepared" the
scouts put into practice lessons they had learned during their time in Cub
Scouts and the Troop. From setting up camp once a month with the Troop, to
setting up a new campsite everynight on the trail, the scouts got to sharpen
their skills in a real life adventure.
