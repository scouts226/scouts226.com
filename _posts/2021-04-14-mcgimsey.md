We had loads of fun at McGimsey! We arrived there on friday night set up tents,
got out patrol boxes, and each patrol had a small dinner mainly consisting of
things like crackers and peanut butter. Saturday morning the patrols got up and
made breakfast! A few of the patrols did pancakes and sausages but of course
each patrol planned their own meals so there was lots of variety. Once done with
breakfast Travis, our senior patrol leader, had the newest patrol split up and
work with some of the older scouts to learn fire safety, knife safety, and work
in the axe yard! The older scouts did an awesome job teaching the younger
scouts. Then the scouts did some conservation by cutting down the invading
bamboo, trimming tree's, and after that Travis had the patrols take a lunch
break.
