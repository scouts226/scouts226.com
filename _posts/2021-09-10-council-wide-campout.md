The Council Wide Campout at Bear Creek was great! During the day, there were
so many fun activities and games to play spread throughout the valley, including
games, relay races, shooting sports, rocketry, cooking, climbing, the OA
village, and a real beehive! In the evening, we enjoyed a fun campfire show!

My favorite part of the campout was exploring the camp to discover all the
activities and games. You never know what you'll find next, and that's an
experience I will always remember.

This was also fun because we had all three of our Scout units together at the
same time! The Webelos (4th and 5th graders) came out Saturday and were served
meals in the dining hall. The boys and girls troops cooked our own meals on the
Rickenbacker side of the valley.
