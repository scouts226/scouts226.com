We had a great place at garner with loads of open space and lots of picnic
tables for all the scouts to eat on. Some had to put their patrol box/chuck box
on the picnic bench but 2 patrols had patrol boxes that stood on their own! All
patrols have these amazing boxes which contain stoves, pots, pans, small fuel
containers, duct tape, lanterns, spices, and so much more! we can't wait to have
your scouts at our campout where them and their patrol can practice their
cooking skills.
