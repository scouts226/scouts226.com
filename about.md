Scouts is a worldwide movement, formed over a hundred years ago. The mission is
"to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on
the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are
self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society."

Community Bible Church (CBC) charters three scout units. The Cub Scout Pack is
for boys and girls in Kindergarten to 5th grade. Scouts BSA is for middle school
and high school, and consists of two troops, one for boys and another for girls.

During the school year, we meet Monday nights at 7:00.

Our unit number, 226 comes from Proverbs 2:26.

> Train up a child in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it.
