    <h2>Scouting</h2>

    <p>You may recognize scouts for "being prepared" or outdoorsy, but there is
    much more to it than that. The mission of scouting is to preparing youth for
    life! To prepare scouts to make good choices, the scouting program focuses
    on character development, leadership development, citizenship training, and
    personal fitness. Our scouting units are blessed to be part of Community
    Bible Church... so preparing youth for life definitely includes their
    eternal life! Scouting provides a great opportunity to practice and discuss
    our duty to God.</p>
