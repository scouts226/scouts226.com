    <h2>Scouting</h2>
    <p>
      You may recognize scouts for ”being prepared” or outdoorsy, but there is
      much more to it than that. The mission of scouting is to preparing youth
      for life! To prepare scouts to make good choices, the scouting program
      focuses on character development, leadership development, citizenship
      training, and personal fitness. Our scouting units are blessed to be part
      of Community Bible Church... so preparing youth for life definitely
      includes their eternal life! Scouting provides a great opportunity to
      practice and discuss our duty to God.
